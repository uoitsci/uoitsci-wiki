### PLA (Polylactic Acid)
PLA is one of the most popular and easiest materials to work with in 3D printing. 
It is made from **renewable resources** such as corn starch and sugarcane, making it 
an environmentally friendly and biodegradable option. This material is ideal for 
beginners due to its low melting temperature and minimal warping during printing.
Unlike some other materials, PLA is generally considered safe to handle and print, 
as it does not emit harmful fumes during printing. However, it is still advisable
to ensure proper ventilation to avoid inhaling microparticles.

Advantages | Disadvantages
:--------- | ------------:
Eco-friendly | Low durability and heat resistance
Ease of printing | Degrade over time in high humidity and high UV environment
Safe | Weak mechanical properties

Nozzle Temperature | Bed Temperature |
------------------ | --------------- |
190 - 230 ºC (usually 210 ºC)  | 40 - 60 ºC (Usually 50 ºC) |


### ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate)
ASA is a popular 3D printing filament known for its excellent weather resistance,
UV stability, and mechanical properties. It is often compared to ABS but offers 
better resistance to environmental factors and is less toxic. 
ASA is a versatile material that provides a good balance of strength, durability, 
and ease of printing. However, it is important to ensure proper ventilation or use 
an air filtration system during printing, as ASA emits **toxic fumes**.

Advantages | Disadvantages
:--------- | ------------:
Weather resistance | Emit toxic fumes
Strong mechanical properties | Prone to warping
Ease of printing | Expensive

Nozzle Temperature | Bed Temperature |
------------------ | --------------- |
240 - 270 ºC | 80 - 100 ºC |

### CF (Carbon Fibre)
