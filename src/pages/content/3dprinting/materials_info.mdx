### PLA (Polylactic Acid) \{#PLA\}
PLA is one of the most popular and easiest materials to work with in 3D printing. 
It is made from **renewable resources** such as corn starch and sugarcane, making it 
an environmentally friendly and biodegradable option. This material is ideal for 
beginners due to its low melting temperature and minimal warping during printing.
Unlike some other materials, PLA is generally considered safe to handle and print, 
as it does not emit harmful fumes during printing. However, it is still advisable
to ensure proper ventilation to avoid inhaling microparticles.

Advantages | Disadvantages
:--------- | ------------:
Eco-friendly | Low durability and heat resistance
Ease of printing | Degrade over time in high humidity and high UV environment
Safe | Weak mechanical properties

Nozzle Temperature | Bed Temperature
:----------------- | --------------:
190 - 230 ºC | 40 - 60 ºC |


### ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) \{#ASA\}
ASA is a popular 3D printing filament known for its excellent weather resistance,
UV stability, and mechanical properties. It is often compared to ABS but offers 
better resistance to environmental factors and is less toxic. 
ASA is a versatile material that provides a good balance of strength, durability, 
and ease of printing. However, it is important to ensure proper ventilation or use 
an air filtration system during printing, as ASA emits **toxic fumes**.

Advantages | Disadvantages
:--------- | ------------:
Weather resistance | Emit toxic fumes
Strong mechanical properties | Prone to warping
Ease of printing | High printing temperature
&nbsp;| Expensive

Nozzle Temperature | Bed Temperature
:----------------- | --------------:
240 - 270 ºC | 80 - 100 ºC |

### Nylon (PA6 or PA12) \{#Nylon\}
Nylon filament is widely used in 3D printing due to its exceptional wear resistance 
and durability. This versatile material can withstand significant impact, stress, 
and strain, making it ideal for high-performance applications. Nylon is known for 
its high flexibility and elasticity, which prevents brittleness. Originally clear 
and colorless, nylon is usually dyed, though improper handling of color additives can 
pose health risks without adequate ventilation. Due to its hygroscopic nature, 
nylon absorbs moisture from the air, which can adversely affect its printing 
performance and quality if not properly dried and stored.
Advantages | Disadvantages 
:--------- | ------------:
High strength and durability | Moisture absorption
Flexibility | Prone to warping
Abrasion and chemical resistance |

Nozzle Temperature | Bed Temperature
:----------------- | --------------:
230 - 260 ºC | 70 - 100 ºC |

### CF (Carbon Fibre) \{#CF\}
Carbon fiber filled filaments are composite materials that blend standard 3D printing 
plastics, such as PLA, PETG, or Nylon, with short carbon fiber strands. This 
combination enhances the material's mechanical properties, offering increased strength, 
stiffness, and reduced weight. These filaments are widely used in applications that 
require high performance and durability. Due to the abrasive nature of carbon fiber 
filled filaments, it is essential to use hardened nozzles to prevent premature wear. 
Proper ventilation is also recommended to **avoid inhaling any microscopic fibers** released 
during printing. Additionally, handling these filaments with care is crucial to 
prevent **skin irritation from carbon fiber splinters**.

Advantages | Disadvantages
:--------- | ------------:
Increased strength and stiffness | Abrasive, damaging the nozzle
Reduced weight | Brittle
Dimensional stability | Difficult to print
Improved thermal and chemical resistance | Expensive

Nozzle Temperature | Bed Temperature
:----------------- | --------------:
Varies on the material | Varies on the material |

### PC (Polycarbonate) \{#PC\}
Polycarbonate (PC) filament is a high-performance material known for its exceptional strength, 
durability, and heat resistance, often considered the strongest 3D printer filament available. 
It can withstand significant stress and impact with high strength and a glass 
transition temperature of 150 °C, making it ideal for high-temperature applications. 
However, printing with PC requires very high temperatures. It is very hygroscopic 
and will readily absorb moisture, which can cause defects in the printed part. Therefore,
proper storage in a dry environment and pre-drying before use are essential.

Advantages | Disadvantages
:--------- | ------------:
High strength and durability | Difficult to print
High heat resistance | Moisture absorption
Dimensional stability | Expensive
Optical clarity | 

Nozzle Temperature | Bed Temperature
:----------------- | --------------:
